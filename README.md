# FreeCodeCamp_Homework_Portfolio
FreeCodeCamp 作业之三：设计一个 Portfolio 页面。本项目未使用任何前端框架。

##  写在 CodePen 作业页面上的描述
This is a homework of "Build a Personal Portfolio Page" @ Freecodecamp. But when I finished my work with Pug, I discovered that I was out of their demand >_<...

So blame it on me. This project will just be a homework for using Pug to build a page!

By the way, currently I seldom use such social media like Weibo, LinkedIn etc, let alone those out of the wall like Facebook, Twitter, Google+.
